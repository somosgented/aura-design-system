# AGENTS.md — Aura Design System

Short constraints for coding agents working in this monorepo. Humans who want the full Lauren Tan / pstack workflow in Cursor desktop still run `/setup-pstack` and `/poteto-mode` from the marketplace plugin — those are **not** vendored here.

## What this repo is

Aura is a **design system monorepo**: tokens, UI components, Ladle stories, docs site, CLI, and agent-facing design specs. Consumers install via shadcn-style registry (`@aura/*`), not by importing this repo as an app.

| Area | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Components + registry source | `packages/registry/registry/default/components/` |
| Ladle stories | `packages/registry/src/*.stories.tsx` |
| Component metadata / docs generation | `packages/registry/metadata/`, `packages/registry/scripts/` |
| Tokens / CSS foundation | `packages/system/`, `packages/styled-system/`, root `DESIGN.md` |
| Design-md package | `packages/design-md/` |
| CLI | `packages/cli/` |
| Docs / marketing site | `apps/www/` |
| Agent rules & project skills | `.agents/rules/` (Cursor loads them through the `.cursor/rules` symlink), `.cursor/skills/` |
| Feature map (only docs; update on PR) | `wiki/obsidian-aura-design-project/Feature-Map/` |

`apps/www/AGENTS.md` is Next.js / site lint guidance only. Prefer **this** file for repo-wide agent policy.

## Preferred workflow

1. **Understand first** — Explore existing exports, stories, and call sites before editing (`/how`-style reading). Do not invent APIs that contradict registry components.
2. **Sketch before drive-by edits** — For new or changed public surfaces, decide props/variants/composition (`/architect`-style) before rewriting files.
3. **Small verifiable units** — One component or token concern per change set when possible.
4. **Verify in-repo** — Stories, typecheck, lint, registry/docs scripts. See `.cursor/skills/aura-verification/SKILL.md`. Do **not** invent Famity / Labelo product E2E here.

## Gardener constraints (hard)

- **Public APIs** — Do not change public component APIs casually. Prefer additive props/variants. Document breaking changes explicitly in the PR.
- **Tokens** — Respect design tokens and `.agents/rules/*` (13px spacing, accent/gray scales, typography). No hard-coded colors/spacing that bypass tokens when tokens exist. Follow root `DESIGN.md`.
- **Stories** — Keep `packages/registry/src/*.stories.tsx` (and metadata/docs as needed) in sync with component API changes.
- **Accessibility** — Do not ship interactive components without keyboard, focus, and basic a11y (roles, labels, focus rings).
- **Scope** — No drive-by refactors outside the task. No unrelated package bumps.
- **No product apps** — Do not add Famity Care, Labelo, or other product-app code here. This repo is the design system only.
- **No code comments** — Agents replicate existing patterns, so a workaround comment legitimizes the hack and spreads it. Fix the root cause instead, and express intent through names, types, and tests. Encode "do not remove" constraints as a type, test, or lint rule. Unjustified lint or TypeScript suppressions are workarounds too. The only allowed comments are external constraints we cannot change (browser quirks, library bugs, platform or spec limits) with the reason stated, functional directives, license headers, and generated code. See `.agents/rules/no-comments.mdc`.

## Cursor rules & skills

- Ownership map: `.agents/rules/aura-agent-surface.mdc` — `DESIGN.md` narrative SoT; `.agents/rules/*` guardrails; `.cursor/skills/*` / `.agents/skills/*` execution.
- Foundation rules live in `.agents/rules/` (`alwaysApply` where marked). Cursor still loads project rules from `.cursor/rules`, which is a symlink to `../.agents/rules`, so there is one copy. Do not invent a second conflicting design policy.
- Those rules stay project rules. Cursor discovers `.agents/skills/shadcn/SKILL.md` on demand; shadcn's `rules/*.md` files are references inside that skill, not always-on policy. Aura procedures stay skills. Guardrails stay `.mdc` rules.
- Monorepo skills: `.cursor/skills/aura-constraints/`, `.cursor/skills/aura-verification/`.
- Consumer skills (registry-synced): `aura-forms`, `verify-aura-ui`, `update-feature-map`, `port-component-to-aura`, `generate-brand-images` — see `packages/registry/scripts/sync-skills.ts`.
- Upstream skills (blueprint / `skills add`, not registry): `.agents/skills/shadcn` (`pnpm dlx skills add shadcn/ui`) and gdp-ts.
- Documentation: `.agents/rules/feature-map.mdc`. On PR, add or update the feature's note in the feature map. Do not read or write other wiki or progress files.
- **Agent-constraint skills stay local** and are not added to `sync-skills.ts` unless intentionally published.

## Third-party audits

Emil Kowalski’s skills, Vercel’s `vercel-react-best-practices`, and WorkOS’s `workos` skill are not part of Aura. Install each from upstream with `npx skills add` only when you want that audit, invoke it by name (for example `/review-animations Revisa las animaciones de este diff`), and apply findings by hand. Do not commit the installed folders. `aura blueprint` deletes the Emil and Vercel copies older Aura versions wrote into `.cursor/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`. Commands and the findings format: `apps/www/content/docs/audits.mdx`.

## Proof-carrying authz (gdp-ts)

`aura init`, `aura setup`, and `aura blueprint` install [`@gdp-ts/core`](https://github.com/rauchg/gdp-ts), its ESLint preset, the `rauchg/gdp-ts` skill, and a starter `proofs/` module (session, org role, project role, plan entitlement, and `deleteProject`). Sensitive functions demand those proofs. Do not cast them. CI is typecheck plus lint. Do not vendor the skill into the registry; the CLI installs it with `npx skills add`. Docs: `apps/www/content/docs/gdp-ts.mdx`.

## Out of scope

- Vendoring or cloning `backnotprop/pstack` or copying its full skill set.
- Vendoring the gdp-ts skill into `packages/registry` or `sync-skills.ts`.
- Modifying `next-famity-care` or any Famity paths (they are not this repo).
- Product runtime features unrelated to the design system, docs, or agent guidance.
