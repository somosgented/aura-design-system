`aura blueprint`, which `init` and `setup` also run, installs the agent surface: Aura rules in `.agents/rules/` (`.cursor/rules` is a symlink to that directory so Cursor still loads them), skills, the forms stack (forms rule, `aura-forms` skill, and the ajv-based form components), shadcn skills, gdp-ts, image identity, and this feature map. Emil, Vercel, and WorkOS skills are not part of Aura. Blueprint deletes the Emil and Vercel copies an older CLI wrote. Forms validate with ajv through `validateFormData`, and server actions re-validate with the same schema. Zod is not used. The feature map is the only project documentation. It has one note per feature and is updated in the PR that changes the feature.
