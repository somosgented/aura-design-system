## Summary
Pass. The field is a labeled command input with a magnifying glass from the command control. The docs demo opens the panel immediately so the results are visible.

## Findings
- Pass. `Search.tsx` sets `aria-label`, placeholder, Escape to collapse, and a frame of `border-gray-6 bg-gray-1`. Items in the demo are foundation names.
- Note. The magnifying glass and the input chrome live on `CommandInput`, which also sets `pl-5` (65px) and `border-transparent!` on `AutocompleteInput`. Empty state in Command uses `not-empty:py-6` (78px). Those classes are outside this page's own file. The Search demo sets `defaultExpanded`.
