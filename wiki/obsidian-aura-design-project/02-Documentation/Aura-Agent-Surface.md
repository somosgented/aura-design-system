## Summary
Aura agent tooling splits into three layers. `DESIGN.md` holds the narrative design SoT. `.cursor/rules/*` hold MUST/SHOULD/NEVER guardrails (including Keep invariants for color, type, 13px spacing, icons, and Project Brain). Skills under `.cursor/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` own persistence and technical execution. Upstream `shadcn/ui` skills are installed via `pnpm dlx skills add shadcn/ui` and stay subordinate to Aura Keep when they conflict.

## Context
